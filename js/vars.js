'The greatest threat to the remaining vaquita is incidental death caused by fishing gear.', 
'Once at a low of 150 in a key habitat, Golden Lion Tamarins suffer from a range of human influences.', 
'This vivid dart frog is the <span>most poisonous species</span>, but it finds itself under considerable threat.', 
'The cute and petite Forest Owl suffers from a number of influences upon its small numbers.', 
'The smallest marine turtle has declined through food and egg exploitation but mainly, accidental <span>capture through shrimp fishing</span>.', 
'The Scimitar Oryx has immensely <span>charismatic horns</span> which proved too valuable a-source not to be hunted to extinction in the wild.', 
'Fiji is a fresh paradise for an array of natural wonders such as one of the only <span>colour-morphing</span> Iguanas, the Fiji Crested.', 
'Unlike many of the species in pieces, the Knysna Seahorse&rsquo;s endangerment is <span>not linked</span> to human activity.', 
'The Three Banded Armadillo of Brazil is a hard nut to crack – with only Pumas and Jaguars powerful enough to be a predatory threat. ', 
'The Pygmy Three-toed Sloths are situated on a lone uninhabited, protected island of Panama.', 
'The evolutionarily distinct Kakapo is one of the many flightless birds which evolved in isolation without predators in New Zealand.', 
'The Long-beaked Echidna is one of the longest serving species on Earth but its time may unfortunately finally be coming to an end.', 
'Once in abundance, the African Penguin’s decline in the past century has occurred with velocity.', 
'This long and vivid damselfly which bares likeness to the Large Red Damselfly, is restricted to very <span>limited ranges</span>.', 
'Sun Bears have a delightful necklace pattern accompanied by a long tongue but their existence may unfortunately be a lot shorter.', 
'A gorgeous array of colours spreads over this large fish but it&rsquo;s this size which helps place it under threat of overfishing.', 
'With <span>25-30</span> Bactrian Camels to be lost per year if current trends continue, this special specimen has a grim-looking future.', 
'Named after <a class="offsite" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Russel_Wallace" target="_blank"><span></span>Alfred R. Wallace</a>, this butterfly&rsquo;s struggles would sadden the great naturalist.', 
'The Somali Ostrich, only declared a unique species as recently as 2014, is another unfortunate victim of human influences.', 
'The Wonderfully playful Red Panda is under threat from the common combination of habitat loss and to a lesser extent, poaching.', 
'This interesting snouty specimen is yet another unfortunate victim of deforestation and hunting. ', 
'This critically endangered Sifaka is under threat from hunting for food, but also primarily <span>loss of the rain forest</span> in its range.', 
'The Iberian Lynx is the world’s rarest cat species and could be the first to become extinct since the Sabre-toothed Tiger.', 
'Once in abundance in Southeast Asia, the Sumatran Rhinoceros is now critically endangered with 50% per decade lost till the early 90s.', 
'A range of problems place this Peccary in danger, hunting being the most significant contributor.', 
'This species which resemble a half-zebra, half-giraffe suffers from the usual combination of habitat loss and poaching.', 
'Wide-eyed and little wonder as like other Loris species, it has been <span>over-exploited</span> by humans.', 
'This critically endangered antelope stares extinction in the eyes, and would be the <span>first mammalian loss</span> in Africa in modern history.',

'Its highly-prized casque is unique in that it is almost completely solid and <span>rich in ivory</span> &ndash; leading to excessive hunting in recent years which is set to increase, with China the largest consumer of the casque. ', 
'Vaquitas are known to die in gillnets set for sharks, rays, mackerels and chano, as well as in <span>illegal and occasionally permitted</span> gillnet sets for an endangered <i>fish called Totoaba.</i> ', 
'Extensive programmes have had fair success in reversing the trend <span>caused primarily by habitat loss</span> but also logging, mining, poaching and animal trade.', 
'Deforestation in the name of agricultural development, humans settling in the frog’s range, logging, and planting as well as spraying for crops have all had a combined effect.', 
'Illegal <span>deforestation</span> and <span>forest fires</span> have a major impact, and encroachment from humans for various reasons is a consistent problem.', 
'Kemp’s Ridley nests are unfortunately easy for both direct <span>predators and humans to find</span>, making growth of the species sporadic at best.', 
'Before this hunting almost saw off the species, <span>climate change</span> in its previous range dramatically affected numbers, when the range Sahara dried up.', 
'However, these forests have undergone consistent and intense degradation through burning, grazing, human settlement and tourism development meaning forestry and beach loss have cost the Iguana dearly.', 
'This seahorse rather, resides in such a limited range that events occurring to these estuaries would be catastrophic for the seahorse. ', 
'But this species finds itself vulnerable from the <span>loss of habitat</span> to allow space for livestock and hunting for food.', 
'However, the lack of residents on the island unfortunately doesn’t stop visitors and plans to develop tourism on the island causes problems for the Sloth&rsquo;s habitat. ', 
'The lack of defences meant that when humans arrived in the range 700 years ago, it was <span>hunted</span> to intensely small numbers followed by further decreases when <span>pest control predators</span> for other species were introduced in the late 1800s.', 
'It hunts using its spiky tongue to find and digest worms, but is itself on the receiving end of <span>hunting, by humans for food</span>. It has also suffered from habitat loss in ranges now densely populated by locals. ', 
'Climate change and pollution from events such as <span>oil spills</span> has had an effect, but depletion of eggs via over-collection and intense fishing in the area has also impacted their status.', 
'This aspect puts the fly under threat as climate change can affect the already <span>poorly managed brooks</span> very easily, and expanding tourism increases the threat.', 
'Hunting and deforestation impact to varying degrees depending on the range, with <span>forest fires, developments and logging</span> all contributing to lost habitat.', 
'This fish coasts into shallow water which increases the risk of being caught by fisherman, but its <span>habitat has also declined</span> rapidly over the past 25 years.', 
'Consistent hunting over the past 30 years has caused significant decline while predation from wolves in the range adds to the problems faced.', 
'Located mainly in the Maluku Islands, the lowland areas of forest where the Butterfly resides has been greatly reduced by logging. The deforestation continues today within commercial context.', 
'With a variety of questionable purposes such as water <span>containers, ornaments and protective religious symbols</span>, their eggs are intensely exploited.', 
'<span>Human numbers in the Panda’s range</span> doubled towards the end of the last Century with previous habitat being turned into housing, farmland and other developments.', 
'Much of the <span>range is uncontrolled</span>, allowing illegal logging to continue, and in Sumatra – its stronghold range – it suffers similar issues to other Sumatra-based species from consistent, relentless <span>loss of forestry</span>.', 
'Despite in theory providing protection, national parks are away from governmental areas meaning that encroaching within the range from local peoples is unmanaged.', 
'<span>The Lynx’s story is tragic</span>. Rabbits declined dramatically, taking away the most important food storage – <span>Myxomotosis</span> spread far and wide through France and Australia, introduced in 1952 by a French gardener attempting to control pests.', 
'Rhinos’ body parts sell for various applications but a horn is <span>worth around &euro;27,000</span>, a major prize for poaching with uses including fabled poison protection.', 
'In Argentina deforestation has soared with <span>33% lost in just 15 years</span>, having a huge impact on Peccary who disappear without more than 87% of cover is left.', 
'<span>Logging and human settlement</span> within the previous range has impacted a steady decline since the mid 90s.', 
'Easily captured through its slow movement, it is captured and used under the mythical pretence that it has <span>healing or magical properties</span>.', 
'Predation, resource competition, poaching and diseases <a class="offsite" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinderpest"><span></span>Rinderpest</a> and Tuberculosis continue to decline numbers.', 
'Human development within the range as well as general habitat loss mixed with illegal hunting has meant declining numbers for many decades.'

'Logging and agricultural conversion is contributing to the ominous pressure of hunting, and restoration is complicated further by the hornbill&rsquo;s <span>slow reproductive cycle</span>.', 
'It is believed that about 30 vaquitas are <br/>lost to these threats each year.', 
'De-forestation limits purported success of re-introduction initiatives. Just <span>8% of original forest</span> habitat size remains, resulting in behavioural effects such as in-breeding.', 
'Only one <a class="offsite" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liophis"><span></span>Snake predator</a> is unaffected by its toxin and terrible taste, but this hasn&rsquo;t deterred international trade, though sparse', 
'The species is low on the food chain with various predators adding to issues, as well as it being <span>hunted for eggs and body parts</span> which are used for items such as drums.', 
'Racoons, Skunks and Coyotes and a portfolio of sea and land-based species find the nests easy as easy prey. ', 
'Since European settlement within the Oryx&rsquo;s range, numbers have only declined further.', 
'Their small frame signals <span>easy prey</span> for beasts such as Black Rats and feral Cats, who also utilise Iguana eggs.', 
'<span>Floods occur</span> within some of the 3 estuaries – the Knysna, Swatvlei and Keurbooms – and mis-management continues these kind of occurrences could lead to <span>total extinction</span>.', 
'The armadillo was the mascot of the <span>2014 World Cup in Brazil</span>, yet only 3% of its range lies within protected areas.', 
'This sloth has become something of a <span>flagship species</span>, resulting in interested humans visiting the island to capture them <span>for captivity</span>.', 
'Looking extinction in the eyes, the Kakapo is a rare recent success story and numbers now continue to <span>grow slowly</span> through an extensive recovery program.', 
'A further development in the form of a <span>nickel mine</span> is being planned in an area with a major population of the Echidna.', 
'One <a class="offsite" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Treasure_oil_spill#Effects_of_the_spill"><span></span>oil spill in June 2000</a> caused a wipeout of 40% of the entire species. If that proportion of loss were to happen to humans today, it would equate to 2.9 billion people.', 
'Water pollution and replacement by concrete have a huge impact on the fly’s habitat, while recent dry summers have at times dried out the brooks completely.', 
'Hunting is actually illegal in all of the Bear’s range but unfortunately as is so often the case uncontrolled, where some areas have <span>seen populations halve</span> in over two decades.', 
'The quality of conditions of habitat which remains – especially <span>coral reefs</span> – is also declining, which Parrotfish use for food and shelter.', 
'The Chinese range of camels is being mined along with other development work, while Mongolia <span>will lose 84%</span> of its current population by 2033.', 
'Mosquitos in the area have also posed a problem indirectly – as they are fought off <span>by insecticides</span> which also affect this beautiful Birdwing.', 
'Direct hunting for food, sport, feather usage for leather and exhaustion through the chase all lead to a very grim future, while the usual case of habitat loss causes further issues.', 
'Human hunting is invariably accidental, though in places the fur is <span>used for caps and other apparel</span>, whilst inbreeding depression adds another threat.', 
'Hunting pressure has increased by the decline of other hunted species within the range still left, though is currently a secondary threat.', 
'When hunted, its fur is used for trade and the meat being used for food.', 
'Little did they know the disastrous effect this would have on such a tremendous species.', 
'Sumatra also has <span>heavy deforestation</span> occurring, but other aspects such as in-breeding depression look to have an even heavier price.', 
'Rounding off these causes for concern is a <span>mysterious disease</span> which has troubled this species for decades.', 
'Complete protection in the Congo and the initiative <a class="offsite" target="_blank" href="http://www.okapiconservation.org"><span></span>Okapi Conservation Project</a> symbolise the very real threat this species faces.', 
'Also kept as an exotic pet, humans have also encroached upon the range and the species looks extinction in the eye.', 
'A sanctuary has recently been put in place with protection from outside influences and supplies a glimmer of light for Hirola&rsquo;s future.', 
'The final 30th pieces is represented by a number of <span>just 3,000 Drills</span> believed to be left, with a highest estimate of 8,000.'
